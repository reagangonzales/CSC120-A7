Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In the Cafe class I overloaded its constructor with one that sets a default cafe with specific attributes, allowing for easier creation of a standard Cafe instance. I overloaded the sellCoffee method to accept just coffee size, defaulting to 1 sugar and cream, this provided a simplier interface, while still allowing full customization if wanted.

In the House class I overloaded its constructor with one that sets a default house with specific attributes, also allowing for easier creation of a standard house instance. The moveOut method is overloaded to handle different numbers of residents moving out, as opposed to the previous method only able to handle moving one resident out.

In the Library class I overloaded the contructor with one that sets Neilson library as the default library, allowing for easier creation of a standard Library instance. The addTitle method is overloaded to support adding a single book title as well as multiple titles at once.

What worked for this assignment was continueing to go to TA hours. Utlizing class notes/ in class demos as reference to help also worked as well. My biggest advice for future students on this assignment specifically is to keep up with documentation, as it clarifies your methods’ purposes and keeps you organized. It’s also a lifesaver when you need to revisit code after a break.
